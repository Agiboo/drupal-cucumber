# Cucumber testing framework for Drupal

This is a little framework I wrote to write front-end tests using Cucumber.  There are some basic functions you can 
use to test Drupal on.  I'll polish documentation later on.

## Prerequisites

You must have Ruby and Rubygems installed.  Use "RVM":http://beginrescueend.com/rvm/install to install it.  Also install
the following gems:

* selenium-webdriver
* rspec
* cucumber
* capybara
* gherkin

Drop me a message if you encounter errors.

You need to install the module to create bulk users, generated per existing role within Drupal.  *TODO* Insert link 
to github module.

## Execute tests

Go to the root of this repo and type "rake test:run".  This will automatically trigger the tests to run.

Good luck
